## COVID-MAP
We made a cool covid map :)

During the development process, we encountered the following problems: 

1. The API that was given in the task did not work. :pushpin:
2. Most of the APIs encountered on the Internet were paid, which is sad ... :pushpin:
3. Too little time was given to the project, especially for a team of two. :pushpin:

You can change the timeline of the map, navigate the time of the spread of the infection and see detailed statistics for the countries!

But despite all the difficulties, we have completed the work, which we can later finish.

Thank you for this opportunity to participate in the project. Bye! ♥️
